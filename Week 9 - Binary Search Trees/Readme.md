# Week 9 Recap - BSTs and Tree Traversals

Carrying on from last week, this week is arguably just as important in CSC148 as last week. You learn about Binary Search Trees and Tree Traversals, and finally sew together the pieces of trees and recursive data structures to understand Binary Search Trees. This week is mostly putting together the pieces from the last few weeks, so provided you've been keeping up with the material, you should be fine.

This week we did less tree-related problems and more theoretical and knowledge-based problems to solidify your understanding of the material. For more practice problems, I've included a few in the [homework.md](homework.md) file.

## Homework:
This week, I've assigned you a relatively tricky problem thats *new* for your class - That's right! No one else has seen this problem before. It's a good exercise to test your understanding of the material, and I'm excited to see how you do. You can find it in the [homework.md](homework.md) file.

## Solutions:
You're in luck! This time you're getting full LaTeX solutions. You can find them in the [solutions](./Solutions/) folder.

All solutions provided are provided outside of FSG hours, and **are not endorsed neither by the UTM RGASC nor the CSC148H5 Course Staff.** These solutions are meant to be used as a reference, and not a replacement for the problem solving process. Use at your own risk. You are encouraged to attend office hours and ask questions during lectures if there are any parts of the solution that you do not understand. Should you find anything that is incorrect, please open an issue on this repository and I will address it as soon as possible.
