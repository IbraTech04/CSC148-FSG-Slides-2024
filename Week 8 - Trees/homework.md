**Chicago Medâ€™s File Problem:** *Dr. Choi* is facing a challenging problem with organizing his medical files. His computer's hard drive contains a complex arrangement of directories and files, forming a *tree-like hierarchical structure.* However, he's noticed that there are numerous duplicate entries scattered throughout this structure, leading to unnecessary clutter and confusion.

To address this issue, Dr. Choi needs assistance in developing a script that will efficiently *remove all duplicate file entries from his directory tree.* Your task is to implement a method that takes the root node of this file system tree as input and eliminates all duplicate file entries, ensuring that each unique file is retained only once. *You can assume the first entry of the file you find is the one to be kept.*
