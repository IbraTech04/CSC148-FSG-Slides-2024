# Week 10: Expression Trees + Efficiency + Midterm Review

This week, we'll be quickly glancing over *Expression Trees* before moving onto the *Midterm Review*. We'll be covering the most important topics of the last 5 weeks (Weeks 5-10), along with important study tips, common tricks placed in questions, and my predictions for the midterm.

This week is a bit different from the others, as we'll be focusing on the midterm review. I'll be providing you with a few practice problems to help you prepare for the midterm, and I'll be giving you a few tips and tricks to help you along the way.

## Homework:

This weeks homework is a bit more *intense* than usual. I've set it up like an actual CSC148 Assignment. You can find it in the [homework.md](Homework/readme.md) file. Homework will be posted **after** the FSG and will be due on the day epoch overflows on 32-bit systems (i.e: January 19, 2038).

The basic gyst is: you'll be making a derivative calculator using Expression Trees. You'll be given a few functions to implement, and you'll be given a few helper functions to help you along the way. You'll also be given a few test cases to help you test your code.

## Solutions:
Solutions can be found in the [solutions.pdf](Solutions/solutions.pdf) file.

Homework solutions can be found in the [Solutions/homework solution](Solutions/homework%20solution/) folder.

**NOTE:** All solutions are provided outside FSG hours, and are not endorsed neither explicitly nor implicitly by the UTM RGASC, or the CSC148 teaching staff. These solutions are meant to be used as a reference, and not a replacement for the problem solving process. You are encouraged to attend office hours and ask questions during lectures if there are any parts of the solution that you do not understand.
