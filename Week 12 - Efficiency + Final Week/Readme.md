# Week 12 Recap - Efficiency and Algorithms

This week was mostly a *prelude* to CSC236 (because of the FSG rules, I can't actually do anything else....), where we talked about the efficiency of algorithms. We discussed the importance of understanding the efficiency of algorithms, and how to analyze big oh, big theta, and big omega efficiency classes. We also talked briefly about the *Master Theorem*, and how we will use it next year to analyze the efficiency of recursive algorithms.

## Homework:
Coming soon, losers

## Solutions:
Coming soon, losers

**NOTE:** All solutions are provided outside FSG hours, and are not endorsed neither explicitly nor implicitly by the UTM RGASC, or the CSC148 teaching staff. These solutions are meant to be used as a reference, and not a replacement for the problem solving process. You are encouraged to attend office hours and ask questions during lectures if there are any parts of the solution that you do not understand.
