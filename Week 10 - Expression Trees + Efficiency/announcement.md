Title: CSC148 FSG Update!

# CSC148 FSG Update!

Heyo, CSC148! Miss me yet? ....no? Okay well in any case, I'm back with your CSC148 FSG Update! 

## CSC148 FSG Slides + Related Links
Those of you who come to my FSG Session know I use the fancy $\LaTeX$ slides. I've noticed a lot of FSG-goers don't know that I post these slides to my GitHub, so I've decided to link it here for ease-of-access. You can find the slides in their respective GitHub repository: [https://github.com/IbraTech04/FSG-Slides/tree/master](https://github.com/IbraTech04/FSG-Slides/tree/master)

Those of you who attended today's FSG know that we used a JamBoard to organize our thoughts on Practice Problem 2 (TreeTheory), so I've linked it [here](https://jamboard.google.com/d/11ejw4M3Y-lRpPjksWG2CCXBEE6K1cYsetlSyY0h7ZXQ/edit?usp=sharing) as well. 

*Note: Google Jamboard is getting shut down later this year, so I've also uploaded a PDF of the Jamboard to the GitHub repository.*
