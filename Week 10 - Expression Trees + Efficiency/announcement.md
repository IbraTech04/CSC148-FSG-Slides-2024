Title: CSC148 FSG Update - March 13th 2024

# CSC148 FSG Update!

Heyo, CSC148! Miss me yet? ....no? Okay well in any case, I'm back with your CSC148 FSG Update! 

## 🛝 CSC148 FSG Slides + Related Links 🔗
Those of you who come to my FSG Session know I use the fancy $\LaTeX$ slides. I've noticed a lot of FSG-goers don't know that I post these slides to my GitHub, so I've decided to link it here for ease-of-access. You can find the slides in their respective GitHub repository: [https://github.com/IbraTech04/FSG-Slides/tree/master](https://github.com/IbraTech04/FSG-Slides/tree/master). This repository is also where I upload FSG Homework and any problems we didn't get to in the session. While this isn't *real* homework that you have to do, I encourage you to try them out and see if you can solve them; They're really great practice!

Those of you who attended today's FSG know that we used a JamBoard to organize our thoughts on Practice Problem 2 (TreeTheory), so I've linked it [here](https://jamboard.google.com/d/11ejw4M3Y-lRpPjksWG2CCXBEE6K1cYsetlSyY0h7ZXQ/edit?usp=sharing) as well. 

*Note: Google Jamboard is getting shut down later this year, so I've also uploaded a PDF of the Jamboard to the GitHub repository.*

## 💾 CSC148: The Midterm FSG Strikes Back 💻

As you all (hopefully 😳) know, your second miterm is fast approaching (March 25th iirc)! I'm sure this is a very stressful and scary deadline, if only there was something that could help.... 🤔



That's all from me! I hope you all have a great week, and I'll see you next week for the Midterm FSG Announcement! 👋
