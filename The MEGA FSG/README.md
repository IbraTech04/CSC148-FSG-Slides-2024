# Week 13 Recap - The MEGA FSG

Alas, we have reached the end of FSGs. It's been a wild, amazing ride and I hope you've enjoyed it as much as we have. This week, we're going to be doing a MEGA FSG, where we'll be covering all the content required for the final exams! 

This week, myself and Helia have collaborated to bring you the BEST FSG yet. We've combined all the content from the previous FSGs and added some extra content to make sure you're ready for the final exam.

## Homework:
If you'd like to keep working on the Derivative Calculator, you can do so. Otherwise, you can start studying for the final exam! This repository has a lot of really great content to review for the final exam, though do remember we are **not** representatives of the CSC148H5 course, so it should be noted that this repository is not a comprehensive review of the course.

## Solutions:
Solutions will be posted **after** the FSG. Nice try, no peeking :P
