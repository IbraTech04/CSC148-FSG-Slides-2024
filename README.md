# Ibrahim's FSG Slides
Repository containing the slides for my FSG sessions

Hello CSC148ers! Welcome to my GitHub repository for the slides for my FSG sessions. I will be uploading the slides for each session here, so you can access them at any time outside our FSG sessions! 

I know I said I don't use slides, but due to popular demand, I will be using slides from now on. 

All PDF files are available under the `Releases` tab. If you're curious about the $$\LaTeX$$ source code, you can find it in its respective week's folder.
