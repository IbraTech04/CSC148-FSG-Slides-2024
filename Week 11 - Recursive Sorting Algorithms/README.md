# Week 11 Recap - Recursive Sorting Algorithms

This week we're covering recursive sorting algorithms, how they differ from iterative sorting algorithms, how we can improve upon O(n^2) complexities, and more! 

This week is a little more of a *lighter* week since there isn't much I can do without explicitly teaching... which I obviously cannot do. Instead, we have a series of activities that show the differences between the sorting algorithms. 

## Homework:
Because I'm such a nice FSG Leader, I've decided to omit homework this week :D

If we don't get to certain questions this week, then that's your "unofficial" homework.

## Solutions:
Solutions will be posted **after** the FSG. Nice try, no peeking :P


**NOTE:** All solutions are provided outside FSG hours, and are not endorsed neither explicitly nor implicitly by the UTM RGASC, or the CSC148 teaching staff. These solutions are meant to be used as a reference, and not a replacement for the problem solving process. You are encouraged to attend office hours and ask questions during lectures if there are any parts of the solution that you do not understand.
