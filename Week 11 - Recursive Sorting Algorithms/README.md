# Week 11 Recap - Recursive Sorting Algorithms

This week we're covering recursive sorting algorithms, how they differ from iterative sorting algorithms, how we can improve upon O(n^2) complexities, and more! 

This week is a little more of a *lighter* week since there isn't much I can do without explicitly teaching... which I obviously cannot do. Instead, we have a series of activities that show the differences between the sorting algorithms. 

## Homework:
Because I'm such a nice FSG Leader, I've decided to omit homework this week :D
> Translation: There isn't anything relevant/worth your time to assign as homework, hence why I'm not assigning any.

If we don't get to certain questions this week, then that's your "unofficial" homework.

## Solutions:
Solutions can be found in the [Solutions](./Solutions) folder.
