# Week 6 Homework - The Chicago Med Recursive Problem

Sharon Goodwin delves into Python in her free time. Sheâ€™s trying to create a series of recursive functions that mutually recurse over each other to determine whether a positive integer is even or odd. Help her create these two functions.

**RESTRICTIONS:**

- You are **NOT** allowed to use **ANY** of Python's integer operations **EXCEPT** subtraction.
- You may **NOT** use **Modulo**.
- Each function must have **EXACTLY** one base-case.
- You **MUST** use mutual recursion.
- You **MAY NOT** use any helper methods.

```python
def is_even(num: int) -> bool:
    """
    Method which uses mutual recursion to determine whether an integer is even or odd.
    """


def is_odd(num: int) -> bool:
    """
    Method which uses mutual recursion to determine whether an integer is even or odd.
    """
```
