# Week Six Recap - Recursion 

This week, we talked about the key terms that you should add to your UltraSheets:tm: for future midterm prep. We also discussed the practice problems found in slides.pdf

## Solutions: 
All solutions can be found in the [solutions.py](solutions.py) file, paired with descriptive comments and writeups for each problem. 

## Hint for the homework question
If you're struggling with the homework question, before looking at the solution try reading the following

Recall in MAT102, we defined an even number as a number in the form $$2n, n \in \mathbb{Z}$$ and an odd number as a number in the form $$2n+1, n \in \mathbb{Z}$$. Consider the amount of times we subtract from the number to reach 0. **If that number is odd, the number is odd. If that number is even, the number is even.** Can we keep track of how many times we subtract from the number using recursion?
