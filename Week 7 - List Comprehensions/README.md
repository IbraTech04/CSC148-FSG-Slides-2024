# Week Seven Recap - List Comprehensions 

This week is a *relatively* chill week; you talk about *List Comprehensions* in Python and how they can be used to make your code more readable and concise. 

## Homework:
This week, Practice Problem II Q3 is a homework problem since we weren't able to get to it. While not required, it is highly recommended that you attempt it.

You are also invited to play around with the `songs` list in [solutions.py](solutions.py) and see if you can come up with your own list comprehensions to achieve your own goals. Here are a few:

- Filter songs based on popularity (Must fall in a certain range)
- Filter songs based on genre
- Filter songs based on artist
- Filter songs based on whether they have a prime number of words in their title

## Solutions: 
Solutions to the practice problems can be found in [solutions.py](solutions.py).

**NOTE:** All solutions are provided outside FSG hours, and are not endorsed neither explicitly nor implicitly by the UTM RGASC. These solutions are meant to be used as a reference, and not a replacement for the problem solving process. You are encouraged to attend office hours and ask questions during lectures if there are any parts of the solution that you do not understand.

## Spotify Scraper:
The file provided in [spotify_scraper.py](spotify_scraper.py) is a simple script that scrapes a song and its metadata from an arbitrary Spotify Playlist. It's completely out of the scope of CSC148, and not required for the FSG. I just thought it would be a fun script to include if anyone was curious how I generated the songs used in solutions.py
