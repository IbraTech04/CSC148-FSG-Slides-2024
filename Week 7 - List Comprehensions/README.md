# Week Seven Recap - List Comprehensions 

This week is a *relatively* chill week; you talk about *List Comprehensions* in Python and how they can be used to make your code more readable and concise. We also reviewed the problems from last (two weeks ago) week's homework and discussed the practice problems found in slides.pdf

## Solutions: 
Solutions will be posted **after the FSG**. Nice try, lurkers :P no peeking. That's what .gitignore is for 

## Spotify Scraper:
The file provided in [spotify_scraper.py](spotify_scraper.py) is a simple script that scrapes the song and its metadata from a playlist I created for this session. It's completely out of the scope of CSC148, and not required for the FSG. I just thought it would be a fun script to include if anyone was curious how I generated the songs used in solutions.py
